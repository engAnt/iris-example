## intro
The goal of this example is to try out the "mlr" package. Training will involve at least three foundational machine leanrning algorithms.
No cross-validation step since this script does __not__ aim to fine tune and pick the best predictor for the iris dataset that will work well on more unseen iris data


## plots
Generated plots are located in the plots folder. 


## observations
 * evenly distributed classes
 - setosa is quite separated from the other two classes
 + versicolor and virginica partially overlap at their boundaries


## train and predict
The [mlr](https://mlr-org.github.io) package is used for quickly training diferent models.


## Conclusion
It Looks like the chosen classification algorithms do very well on the iris dataset 
with accuracies of 96% for naive bayes and 98% for the others.
